# Qubic Educational Media Campaign

**Submitted by:** The Great Crypto Escape  
**Duration:** 3 Months  
**Funding Requested:** 1.5 Billion Qubic per Month (Total: 4.5 Billion Qubic)

---

## Executive Summary

I am requesting 1.5 billion Qubic per month for 3 months to reduce my current employment hours and dedicate focused time to producing high-quality, educational content for the Qubic ecosystem. This initiative will result in:

- 50 YouTube videos over 3 months
- 60+ X (Twitter) posts
- 1 fully produced documentary-style video on the theory that CFB is Satoshi Nakamoto

This content will help educate, onboard, and grow the Qubic community during a period of rapid potential growth and global attention.

## About Me

I am an experienced content creator that runs several YouTube channels. My channel and X account named “The Great Crypto Escape” focus on cryptocurrency and emerging blockchain technology.

**My social follow numbers are:**
- 8,000+ YouTube subscribers
- 4,000+ followers on X (Twitter)

Since discovering Qubic, my sole focus has been on producing consistent content on the project to help educate and update the community. My videos have become well-known in Qubic circles for being informative, investigative, and accessible.

I have already invested thousands of hours researching Qubic and the broader crypto industry, giving me a deep understanding of both the technical and economic landscapes. This level of product and industry knowledge is invaluable when creating accurate, engaging, and useful content for both beginners and veterans in the space.

My mission has always been to be a trusted, go-to resource for Qubic education, news, and insight.

## Problem

Qubic currently does not have a strong presence on YouTube, and there are relatively few videos appearing in Google searches for many common Qubic-related queries. This means many people searching for information about Qubic find little relevant or high-quality content.

Each YouTube video takes around 5 hours to produce (research, scripting, recording, editing, thumbnail design, uploading, sharing). Despite averaging 1,000 views per video, my channel earns less than $30 per month, making regular video production unsustainable while managing a full-time job and new family commitments (I had a baby boy this year).

Community demand for more of my videos has remained strong. To meet this demand, I plan to reduce my current employment work hours by 30%, which will give me the time necessary to produce high-quality, consistent content—but I need support to offset the resulting loss in income.

## Funding Breakdown

| Month    | Hours | Effective Hourly Rate |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| Month 1  | 145   | ~$25.86/hr             |
| Month 2  | 145   | ~$25.86/hr             |
| Month 3  | 120   | ~$31.25/hr             |
| **Average** | 410   | **~$27.44/hr**         |

**Requested:** 1.5 billion Qubic/month × 3 months = 4.5 billion Qubic  
**Estimated Value:** ~$2,500 per billion = $3,750/month  
**Total Value:** $11,250 over 3 months

This hourly rate is significantly lower than standard freelance content production rates, which often range from $40–$100/hr for similar work. This makes the proposal a highly efficient investment in Qubic content creation.

## Expected Reach & Growth Potential

### Baseline projections:
- With 1,000 views per video on average, 50 videos will bring in a minimum of 50,000 views

### Growth projections:
- With an upcoming altseason and rising interest in Qubic, viewership is expected to 10x–20x, reaching 500,000 to 1,000,000+ views

This surge in visibility would amplify the impact of the videos and help bring new users into the Qubic ecosystem.

This campaign is designed to create long-term sustainability for my channel. With increased content output, optimized publishing, and improved visibility, my goal is to:

- Grow my audience
- Increase YouTube monetization
- Reach a point where Qubic-related content can be self-sustaining through organic ad revenue

This short-term funding would make that growth possible at a critical time for the project and the market.

## Cost Efficiency

- Hourly cost: ~$27.44/hr across all production work
- Market comparison: Lower than hiring freelance professionals or agencies
- Experience: Backed by thousands of hours of Qubic research and direct experience with the crypto space
- Delivery: Tailored, community-native content from a creator with a proven voice and audience

## Conclusion

This proposal presents a cost-effective, high-impact plan to create timely, evergreen, and in-depth Qubic content. It’s an opportunity to boost onboarding, grow awareness, and preserve essential Qubic knowledge through video.

With strategic timing, professional-grade production, and long-term goals, this campaign will provide lasting value to the Qubic ecosystem.
